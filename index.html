            <p>Bone marrow transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is one of the most important types
                of treatment for our wards. The scope of this method is constantly expanding, and the technology of
                transplantation is constantly being improved. Bone marrow is the spongy, fatty tissue inside our bones.
                It creates the following parts of the blood:</p>

                <p>
                    Recovery Clinic is one of the largest and well-equipped clinics in London. It is included in the
                    rating of the best hospitals in the UK in 2019 according to the authoritative magazine Modern
                    Oncology. Over 20 bone marrow transplants are performed here monthly, which exceeds the plan from
                    the Ministry of Health by three times.

                    The clinic works closely with research institutes, patients have the opportunity to participate in
                    medical research and receive treatment according to the latest protocols. Thanks to this, even the
                    most severe forms of blood diseases are successfully treated in the oncohematology department.

                    <p>Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant tumor that usually affects the bones. Among malignant bone tumors in children, it takes the second place after osteosarcoma in the frequency of occurrence. Most often, it occurs in long tubular bones (such as the femur, tibia, fibula, humerus), as well as in the pelvic bones, ribs, vertebrae, shoulder blades, etc. Damage to flat bones, such as the pelvic bones, ribs, or shoulder blades, is much more common with Ewing's sarcoma than with osteosarcoma. From the primary bone lesion, the tumor quickly spreads to the surrounding soft tissues, including muscles and tendons.</p>

                    <p>Immunodeficiency is associated with the loss of one or several components of the immune system or non-specific factors that are in close interaction with it. Primary immunodeficiency is a congenital disorder caused by genetic disorders or a negative effect on the fetus during its intrauterine development. Secondary immunodeficiencies occur in representatives of various age groups against the background of diseases or the negative effects of external factors. This type can be found much more often than the first one.</p>

                    <p>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of diseases that are characterized by impaired hematopoiesis of the myeloid line. As a result of these disorders, the possibility of producing mature blood cells is partially preserved, but there is a deficit of one or another of their species, while the cells themselves are altered and function poorly. A large percentage of patients with MDS suffer from acute myeloid leukemia after a certain period of time, usually from several months to several years. In everyday life, MDS is sometimes called "preleukemia".</p>

                    <p>Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary genetic anomaly in the structure of hemoglobin (an oxygen-transporting protein contained in red blood cells), characterized by the presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells (in the form of a crescent) and chronic anemia caused by excessive destruction of pathological red blood cells. Such patients always have anemia, and sometimes jaundice. Sickle cells are fragile and easily destroyed. They are inelastic, so they can hardly pass through the smallest blood vessels (capillaries), obstructing blood flow and reducing the amount of oxygen delivered.</p>

                    <p>Leukemia is an oncological disease in which bone marrow cells mutate, not developing into normal mature white blood cells, but becoming cancer cells. Leukemia differs from other types of cancer in that it does not form a tumor in any one place, and cancer cells are present in the blood and bone marrow, sometimes also in the lymph nodes, spleen and other places in the body. It is not a hereditary disease, however, it can sometimes be diagnosed in representatives of several generations of the same family. In some hereditary or congenital diseases, the mechanism of restoration of genetic material is impaired, and the risk of acute leukemia is significantly increased.</p>
